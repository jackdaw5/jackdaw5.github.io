### Objectives

The objective of this project is to learn the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) query language, by creating your own profile page.

You'll use the GraphQL endpoint which is provided by the platform (`https://((DOMAIN))/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql`). You'll be able to query your own data to populate your profile page.

So that you can access your data, you'll need to create a login page.

Your profile must display three pieces of information which you may choose. For example:

- Basic user identification
- XP amount
- grades
- audits
- skills

Beside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.
